"Overview advice","As little time is spent in MPI calls, this code may also benefit from running at larger scales."

"CPU Advice 1","The per-core performance is memory-bound. Use a profiler to identify time-consuming loops and check their cache performance."
"CPU Advice 2","Little time is spent in vectorized instructions. Check the compiler's vectorization advice to see why key loops could not be vectorized."
